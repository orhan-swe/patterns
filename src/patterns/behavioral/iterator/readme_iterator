great for navigation without exposing the structure of the object
efficiant way to traverse a container
decouples the data from the algorithms
sequentialn
interface based
factory method based

pitfalls
	no access to index
	directional (although list iterator can go back)
	

iterator vs for loop
interfacebasedn/traversal in client
algorirhm is removed
no index/exposes index
concurrent modification
	

example
	java.util.Iterator
	java.util.Enumeration
