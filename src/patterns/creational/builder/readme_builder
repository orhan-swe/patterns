create objects that may contain a lot of prameters and make it immutable

Concepts:
	handles complex construction
	large number of parameters
	
Examples
	StringBuilder
	DocumentBuilder
	Locale.Builder
	
Design
	flexibility over telescoping constructors
	static inner class
	calls appropriate constructor
	
Pitfalls
	inner static class
	designed first (usually no refactor)
	complexity
	
Builder/Prototype
handles complex constructors/implemented around a clone
no interface needed/avoids calling complex constructors
can be a seperate class/difficult to implement in legacy
works with legacy
