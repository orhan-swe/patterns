used to represent and define (establish and interprit) the gramer of a language
to parse veriase aspects of the grammer
building expression on top of one another
but has next to nothing to do with parsing
grammer could be music notation or math equations
or another language
compilers will use it to parse source code
map a domain specific language
used to define an Abstract Syntax Tree(AST)
relies on the recursive traversal of the Composite pattern
replaces if and switch statements, a solution that would not
be sustainable

pitfals:
	complex
	specific case

Iterpreter vs visitor
access to properties/needs observer functionality
function as methods/functionality found in one place
adding neew functionality changes every variant/
adding new variant requires changing every visitor

Examples:
	java.util.Pattern (used for compiler regular expression)
	java.text.Format (used for dates, numbers and strings (local sensitive))
