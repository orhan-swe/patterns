Concept:
	only one instance created
	lazily loaded

Examples:
	runtime
	logger
	spring beans
	graphic managers
	
Design:
	on class
	static in nature
	mulithread considerations
	private instance and constructor
	
Pitfalls
	overused
	difficut to unit test in java due to private
	not thread safe by default
	constructor can not have parameters, becomes factory
	
Singleton
same instance all the time/several instances
no args/multiple constructors
no interface/interface driven
####/adapts to env more easily
