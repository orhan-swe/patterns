concepts
	connect new code with legacy code
	plug adaptor
	conver interface into another interface
	legacy
	translates requests
	client, adapter, adaptee
	
examples
	arrays -> lists
	streams
	
design
	client centric
	integrate new with old
	interface, but not required
	adaptee can be the implementation
	can provide multiple adapters
	
Pitfalls
	dont complicate
	muliple adapters
	dont add functionality
	
Adapter/Bridge
works after code is designed/designed upfront
legacy/build in advanced
retrofitted
provides different interface
