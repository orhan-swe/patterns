decoupeling pattern when we have subject that needs to 
	be observed by one or more observers
	
concepts:
	one to many observers
	decoupled
	event handling
	pub/sub although pub/sub is asynch and observer is synch
	mostly used in mvc
	
Examples
	java.util.Observer
	java.util.EventListener
	javax.jsm.Topic
	
Design:
	Subject - inteface/abstract that we make concreate implns of
	Observer - interface based with verous concrete implementations
	Views are Observers in even driver app
	
Pitfalls:
	Unexpected update
	Large size consequences
	what changed?
	debugging can be difficult

Observer/Mediator
One-to-many/One-to-one-to-Many
Decoupled/decoupled
broadcast communication/Complex Communication in more direct model
