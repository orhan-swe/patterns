often used to get a unique instance of same object (prototype)

concept
	avoids costly creation
	avoids subclassing
	typically don't use "new"
	often utilizes an Interface
	usually implemented with a Registry

Design
	clone/cloneable
	avoids keyword "new"
	although a copy, each instance is unique
	costly construction not handled by client 
	can use shallow(emidiet properties) or deep(references also) copy

Pitfalls:
	not clear when to use
	usually used with another pattern
		registry
	shallow vs deep copy
	
Prototype/Factory
light weight construction/flexible objects
	copy constructor or clone/multiple constructors
shallow or deep/concrete instance
copy of itself/fresh instance
