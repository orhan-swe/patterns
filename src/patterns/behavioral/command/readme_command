Encapsulate request as an object
very similar to memento but emphasis on request
object oriented callback
decouple invoker (sender) from receiver (processor)(one of key reasons for use)
when decoupling ui from login 
logic may be invoker and ui processor
often used for undo functionality as one can store state in command
usually used with other patterns 
 if duplicating logic in another command use composite or 
 combine with chainOfResponsibility
 for undo try to combine with momento
 if storing history look at prototype to store in a list
 
 Command vs strategy:
 object (request) per command/strategy
 contains what/how
 encapsulates action/algorithm
 
 otherwise can look very similar
 
 
 
examples:
	java.lang.Runnable
	javax.swing.Action
	
	
Desing
Pbject per command
command interface
exute method
unexecute method
reflection may be used for uncoupleing
command, invoker, concreteCommand
