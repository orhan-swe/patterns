Concepts:
	eliminate conditional statements
	behavior encapsulated in classes
	difficult to add new strategy
	client aware of strategies
	client chooses strategy
	
Examples:
	java.util.Comparator
	
Design
	abstract base class
	concrete class per strategy
	removes if/else from application
	strategies are independent
	
Pitfals:
	client aware of strategies
	more classes
	
Strategy/State
client know about all strategies/client does not know about states
alg independent/transitions
class per alg/class per state
