used when we need to represent state in an application
localize state behvaior
seperates what form where
ocp - open close principle, states are open for extentions

Examplse:
	none in java api
	JSF
	Iterator - not really
	
Design
	abstract class/interface
	class based
	context unaware (removes if and elesif)
	
Pitfall:
	must know your states
	more classes
	keep logic out of context
	state change triggers can be harder to identify
	
State/Strategy
interface based/interface based
transitions/algorithms are independent
class per state/class per algorithm
