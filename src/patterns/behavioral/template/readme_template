Concepts:
	code reuse
	very common
	IoC (hooks are only called by super class)

Design
	 abstract base class
	 base calls child by calling hook methods
	 hooks are usually overridden
	 
pitfall:
	restrict access
	confusing hierarchy
	different program flow
	
Template method
	same algorithm/ alg per strategy
	class based/ interface based 
	compiled time / run time(select while using app)
