very similar to command but empeses on history and state rather then request
used to externolize the object state usually to provide rollback functionality
restore object to previos state
	externolize internal state, so object can be returned to it later
	undo/redo
	shields complex internals
	
Examples:
	java.util.Date	(internaly represented by long value, return to
					previous state by sending it back to that long value
	java.io.Serializable	allows you to implement any object to have its state
							recreatable

Design:
	class based
	originator
	caretaker
	memento
	magic cookie/token - state stored in new object
	
Pitfalls:
	can be expensive
	deletes history
	exposing information
	
Memento vs Command
State captured/request captured
Independent state/independent request
Caretaker-History/history side benifit
